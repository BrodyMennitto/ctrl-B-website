<p>The members of <strong>ctrl-B</strong> met while learning to navigate open-source coding platforms and DIY electronics in a community college class. Where any of it would lead, no one was exactly sure—but it was fun figuring it out along the way. Not long after, their first performance came together under similar circumstances, and in a way, this has informed the underlying narrative of the project. The experimental trio seeks to create something beautiful in an ever-changing, unpredictable world, to roll with it when things fall apart, and to have as much fun with the process as things evolve.</p>

<p>The members had spent nearly a year studying computer programming, microcontrollers, basic electronics, and sound design together before their cohort was challenged to create a group installation that utilized their newly acquired skills. The weeks of brainstorming that followed were overwhelming. For lack of better options, <strong>Ben Engen</strong>, <strong>Candace Houston</strong>, and <strong>Brody Mennitto</strong> decided to lean into their newly formed friendship, break off into a subgroup, and compose a piece that combined their interests in electronics and experimentation with their performance backgrounds.</p>

<p>For their first session together, percussionist <strong>Ben</strong> and violinist <strong>Candace</strong> had their instruments with them. With nothing else available, <strong>Brody</strong> decided to use the piano in the room—and that was that. Their debut performance, part of <em>The (Secret) Third Thing</em>, was a partially composed, partially improvised piece for piano, violin, drums, and a prototype of an electronically amplified chordophone instrument. The performance was met with an enthusiastic response and encouragement to keep going. Since then, the trio has continued to explore their love of DIY electronics and abstract improvisation, landing somewhere between jazz, classical, electronica, and the avant-garde. They are currently making their mark within Portland’s experimental and noise scene.</p>

<p><strong>Drummer and percussionist Ben Engen</strong> holds a Bachelor of Science in Percussion Instruments from <strong>Southern Oregon University</strong>, where he performed with symphonies, classical ensembles, and jazz bands. He later became known for his work as a drummer in the Seattle and Portland music scenes and continues to work professionally as an audio engineer. <strong>Ben</strong> is also a member of Portland metal/alt-rock duo <strong>Ritual Machine</strong> and is currently pursuing a career in electrical engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Violinist Candace Houston</strong> was born in Southern California and grew up in Vancouver, WA, where she studied violin from a young age and performed in youth symphonies while attending the <strong>Vancouver School of Arts and Academics</strong>. After a brief period living and working in the southwestern U.S., she returned to the Northwest and began studying in PCC’s <strong>Music and Sonic Arts</strong> program. <strong>Candace</strong> is an active multi-instrumentalist in Portland’s DIY punk scene and is working to launch her own plant-based meat alternative business.</p>

<p><strong>Pianist, occasional bassist, and noise-maker Brody Mennitto</strong> moved to Portland, OR from Pittsburgh, PA in 2007 and has since devoted much of their time to playing in Portland’s vibrant DIY and punk scene. Largely self-taught, <strong>Brody</strong> has continued honing their craft since becoming a student at PCC and is currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Sonic Arts and Music Production</strong> at <strong>Portland State University</strong>. <strong>Brody</strong> is also a member of the post-hardcore trio <strong>Inny</strong>, and when not making music, writes, draws, goes to shows, and watches a lot of movies.</p>

<p>The first recordings of <strong>ctrl-B</strong>—engineered by <strong>Evan Mersky</strong> at <strong>Red Lantern Studio</strong> and later mixed by the band—are scheduled for release in 2026. In the meantime, videos of several performances can be found at <a href="http://www.ctrl-b-pdx.lol" target="_blank">www.ctrl-b-pdx.lol</a>.</p>
